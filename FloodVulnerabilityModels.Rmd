```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Possible approaches for statistical analyses
Exploring some different statistical approaches to use for the Flood Vulneratbility Models. We want to fit a multinomial mixed model or a multinomail model with the following variables:
1) Response: Numbers of individuals in different racial groups in each tract
2) Predictor: Flood Risk, at the tract level

## Questions
1) Are there multiple time points, or just a snapshot in time?
2) We could include random effects- of what? County?



```{flood vulnerability}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
