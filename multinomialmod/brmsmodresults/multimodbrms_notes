King county, Pierce county and Snohomish very slow! perhaps because they're so big?
why so slow?


#With 3000 iteration and 1500 for warmup
#1: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
#Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess 
#2: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
#Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess

# #seems to have trouble estimating effect of floodStatus on , asian, and other populations for this county (53001)
# # effect of floodstatus is flat for all races ; still get TESS and BESS warnings with 3000 on county 53003
# #Good model fit on 53005!
# 
#
#53019= some problems estimating other
# 
# 53025= ESS, TESS warnings
# 
# 53039: large error bars for asian- perhaps lump with other? very low number/prob in flood (<1)
